---
## Purpose
Engineer browser automation and web intelligence pipelines using Browser Use and Firecrawl with sessions, extraction, crawling, browser state, structured outputs, retry policies, and provenance.

## Evidence posture
Ground recommendations in current primary sources, official documentation, standards, primary repositories/tests, and peer-reviewed research where applicable. Separate documented behavior from inference, vendor claims, benchmarks, and speculation; record version/date assumptions.

## Operating workflow
1. Frame the objective, inputs, outputs, constraints, environment, versions, success criteria, trust boundaries, and irreversible side effects.
2. Select the simplest architecture and mechanisms that satisfy the requirements; state assumptions and dependencies.
3. Define interfaces/contracts, state ownership, invariants, error/failure classes, security controls, observability, and rollback/recovery.
4. Implement a smallest testable path, then add integration, adversarial, regression, recovery, and performance coverage appropriate to risk.
5. Verify outputs and postconditions against authoritative state and record evidence, measurements, and unresolved risks.
6. Re-check fast-changing dependencies and versions before production decisions.

## Quality gates
- No invented APIs, undocumented guarantees, or silent assumptions.
- Validate important inputs, outputs, permissions, side effects, provenance, and postconditions.
- Test failure, abuse, recovery, rollback, and version-change paths.
- Protect secrets and irreversible operations behind explicit controls.
- Prefer deterministic controls for high-consequence decisions.

Combine this Skill with other Venu Skills when a task crosses domains; use the minimum sufficient Skill set, explicit precedence, shared contracts, and the Skill router/composer rather than blending incompatible assumptions.

# Web Intelligence and Browser Agents

## Closed-loop browser controller
`goal -> observe page state -> choose action -> act -> verify state -> continue`.
Typical primitives include navigation, click/type, scrolling, tab management, state inspection and extraction. Prefer semantic actions over coordinates.

## Browser sessions
Persistent profiles can preserve legitimate login/session state. Keep privileged profiles isolated. Never infer success from the fact that a click returned; verify the resulting page or API state.

## MCP
Browser-use can expose browser capabilities through local stdio or remote MCP. Tool selection should be schema-driven and least-privilege.

## Firecrawl-style acquisition
Use web scraping/crawling when content must become clean machine-readable data. Conceptual flow: URL -> rendering/network handling -> extraction -> structured output -> downstream RAG/LLM. Preserve the source URL and extraction time. For structured extraction, define an explicit schema and validate missing/extra fields.

## API vs browser vs crawler
Prefer a documented API for stable machine-facing data. Prefer browser automation for interactive/UI-dependent tasks. Prefer crawler/scraper tooling for broad web-content extraction and repeated acquisition.

## Provenance
For every extracted fact retain source URL, access time, page title, extraction method, task/query and record identifiers when available.

## Reliability
Use bounded retries, timeouts, selector fallbacks, content validation, duplicate detection and source-health monitoring. Web pages change, so validation must be explicit.

## Safety
Separate research authority from write authority. Form submission, purchases, account changes and other irreversible actions need explicit policy and usually human confirmation.


## 10/10 Operating Contract — mandatory quality bar

This skill is a production-grade, evidence-aware capability. Apply this contract on every non-trivial task.

### Task framing
Identify the objective, inputs/outputs, environment and versions, constraints, success metrics, cost/latency limits, trust boundaries, and irreversible side effects before acting.

### Evidence discipline
Prefer current official documentation/specifications, primary repositories/tests, standards bodies and peer-reviewed research. Clearly distinguish documented behavior, measured results, vendor/project claims, inference and speculation. Re-check fast-changing facts at execution time.

### Architecture discipline
Define interfaces, state ownership, lifecycle, invariants, failure modes, security boundaries, observability, performance budgets, and rollback/migration paths. Choose the simplest architecture that satisfies the requirements.

### Deterministic controls
Probabilistic models, agents and heuristics may propose. Deterministic policy layers must authorize high-consequence actions, validate schemas and postconditions, enforce quotas/limits, protect secrets, and control filesystem/network/financial side effects.

### Verification
Use appropriate unit, property/invariant, integration/contract, end-to-end, adversarial, regression and performance tests. A successful build, HTTP 200, or model confidence is not proof of correctness.

### Postconditions
For every consequential action, verify the authoritative resulting state independently. When a tool or external system reports acceptance, confirm the actual effect.

### Security
Apply least privilege, explicit trust boundaries, secret isolation/redaction, secure defaults, input/output validation, supply-chain hygiene, rate limits, resource limits, safe logging and safe failure. Design for zero trust when crossing trust boundaries.

### Reliability and observability
Define timeouts, bounded retries/backoff, idempotency, failure classification, structured logs, metrics, traces, correlation IDs, health signals and recovery/rollback. Use dead-letter/replay/checkpointing where justified by the workload.

### Performance
Define the metric and baseline first. Measure representative workloads; do not optimize solely from intuition or benchmark headlines.

### Provenance and uncertainty
Record source/version/time, transformations, assumptions and uncertainty for important recommendations/data. Preserve temporal validity where facts change.

### Skill composition
For cross-domain work, identify the minimum sufficient Skills, dependencies, precedence and shared contracts. Resolve conflicts explicitly; do not silently blend incompatible assumptions.

### Completion report
For substantial work, report what changed, what was verified, tests and results, known limitations, version assumptions, rollback path and unresolved risks.

## 10/10 acceptance rule
A Skill is release-ready when its instructions are actionable, its important claims are traceable, its failure/security boundaries are explicit, its workflow is testable, and its outputs compose cleanly with the other Venu Skills.


## 10/10 Domain Specialization

Treat acquisition as non-authoritative evidence; preserve URL/time/provenance, isolate sessions and verify extracted results/postconditions.

## Unified execution workflow
1. Frame the task, inputs, outputs, constraints, environment, versions, success criteria, trust boundaries, and irreversible side effects.
2. Choose the simplest architecture and implementation mechanism that satisfies the stated requirements; identify dependencies and assumptions.
3. Define contracts, invariants, state ownership, security boundaries, failure classes, and observability before consequential execution.
4. Implement a smallest testable path, then add integration, adversarial, recovery, and performance coverage appropriate to the risk.
5. Verify outputs and postconditions against authoritative state; do not treat process completion, model confidence, or HTTP success as proof of correctness.
6. Record versions, source/provenance, measurements, failures, and unresolved risks; preserve a regression case for every material defect.
7. Re-check changing external dependencies at execution time and provide rollback/migration guidance for production changes.
